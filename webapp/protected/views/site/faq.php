	  	Absolutly, remember that Stirplate is a product made by a scientists who knows how much hard work goes into creating a single dataset. 
	  	Here is a small list of how your data is safe with us:
	  	<br>
	  	<br>
		<li> Revision history: Sometimes we make mistakes with our files or delete them by accident. No problem, you can simply go back (up to 25 different versions) and fix that file. Simple. </li>
		<li>All files are backed up on multiple different servers. Even if you delete a file, we can recover it quickly. </li>
		<li> All files stored on Stirplate are encrypted, sent security via SSL and are even guarded by armed guards. </li>

    <h3 class="panel-title">What happens to my data if stirplate.io closes?</h3>
  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
	We aren’t going anywhere, but if something was to happen, we can send you all of your files/info in the same organization that you currently have them on our system (by project). You will never lose your data on Stirplate.

	    <h3 class="panel-title">Is my scientific data shared with the public?</h3>
	  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">
	No, everything is private unless you choose to share it with others. If you have a dataset that you would like to be made public to fit into the requirements set by NIH and NSF however, we will happily host those datasets for free(open only to other scientists). The Stirplate team loves open science, but we understand that data needs to be kept private while it’s being worked on. No one wants to get scooped and we take your data security seriously.

	    <h3 class="panel-title">I use dropbox or my own servers, why is this better?</h3>
	  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">We love Dropbox and think they are doing a great job. In fact, we use these services at Stirplate. Stirplate is different in the following ways:<br><br>
<li> Files stored on Stirplate are stored on HIPPA compliant servers at no cost to you. 
<li> Stirplate is made for scientists. File sharing is a big part of this, but being able to communicate in 1 centralized location, AND send files, and view/edit the files in one place is something that the other groups can’t offer </li>
<li> We automate your analysis and centralize it. No excel, no graphing programs, and no need to make sure everyone has the same version of the software. One place to do your analysis, send the results to collaborators, and communicate about those data.</li>
<li> We’ve made it easier to view your files without having to drill down through a file structure. You don’t have to tell your collaborators that the file is located in /Project2/Immuno/Testresults/12-13-13/file2.xls. Simply star it on the project and ou are done. </li>  
<li> Store for free: Any public dataset that is on Stirplate will not count towards your data quota. So that preliminary data, or negative data sitting around collecting dust could be used to answer more questions and getting you credit for your work.

  <div class="panel-body">
No problem and we understand. We’ve dealt with some really bad science software! Stirplate was founded by someone who has been told “This is the new best thing” hundreds of times, only to be let down when the product was implemented. This is frustrating and wastes time, but we are confident that you will love Stirplate once you give a shot. Any of our paid features have a 30 day free trial, no credit card needed. All of our other services are free so put up a few projects and give it a shot. If you don’t like it, simply delete your account. Want more infomation?
