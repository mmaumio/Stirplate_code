   Stirplate is founded by Keith Gonzales PhD, a former hacker turned neuroscientist. 
Keith worked professionally in IT for 4 years before starting his career in science and found himself always being the “IT guy” of the lab. Frequently fixing the same issues in every lab he worked in, he decided to start Stirplate to help every lab deal with their data needs.
Keith’s PhD is in Behavioral Neuroscience at The University of NY at Albany, and did post-docs at Weill Cornell Medical College, Rockefeller University, and Columbia University.
